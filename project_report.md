# AI for Sustainable Development: CO2 Emissions Prediction Model
## Addressing SDG 13: Climate Action through Machine Learning

### Introduction
Climate change represents one of the most significant challenges facing humanity today. As part of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Goal 13 specifically targets climate action, calling for urgent measures to combat climate change and its impacts. This project leverages machine learning to contribute to this global effort by developing a predictive model for CO2 emissions.

### Problem Statement
Understanding and predicting CO2 emissions is crucial for:
- Developing effective climate policies
- Identifying high-emission areas
- Planning mitigation strategies
- Monitoring progress towards emission reduction goals

### Technical Solution
Our solution implements a Random Forest Regressor model that predicts CO2 emissions based on three key indicators:
1. GDP per capita
2. Energy consumption
3. Population size

The model was developed using Python and several key libraries:
- scikit-learn for machine learning implementation
- pandas for data manipulation
- matplotlib and seaborn for visualization
- requests for data fetching

### Data and Methodology
The model uses real-world data from the World Bank API, with the following approach:
1. Data Collection: Fetches historical data for CO2 emissions and related indicators
2. Preprocessing: Handles missing values and normalizes data
3. Model Training: Implements Random Forest Regressor with 100 trees
4. Evaluation: Uses multiple metrics (MAE, MSE, R²) for comprehensive assessment

### Results
The model demonstrates strong predictive capabilities:
- High R² score indicating good fit
- Low Mean Absolute Error for practical applications
- Clear feature importance visualization showing the relative impact of each factor

### Ethical Considerations
Several ethical aspects were considered in the development:
1. Data Bias: The model accounts for potential biases in data collection
2. Fairness: Predictions are contextualized within development stages
3. Transparency: Model decisions are explainable through feature importance analysis

### Impact and Applications
This model can be used by:
- Policymakers for climate action planning
- Researchers studying emission patterns
- Organizations monitoring their carbon footprint
- Educational institutions teaching about climate change

### Future Directions
Potential improvements include:
1. Integration of more data sources
2. Implementation of additional ML models
3. Development of a web interface
4. Addition of time-series analysis

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can contribute to addressing climate change, aligning with SDG 13's objectives. By providing accurate predictions of CO2 emissions, it offers valuable insights for climate action planning and policy development.
