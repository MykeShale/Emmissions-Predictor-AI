# CO2 Emissions Prediction Model for SDG 13: Climate Action 🌍

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to predict CO2 emissions based on various economic and social factors, contributing to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 13: Climate Action. The model uses real-world data from the World Bank API to analyze and predict CO2 emissions per capita based on GDP, energy consumption, and population metrics.

## Problem Statement
Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time, and understanding the factors that contribute to CO2 emissions is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. This project aims to:
- Predict CO2 emissions based on key economic and social indicators
- Identify the most significant factors influencing emissions
- Provide insights for policymakers and researchers working on climate action

## Technical Implementation
The project uses the following technologies and approaches:
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Key Libraries**: 
  - scikit-learn for machine learning
  - pandas for data manipulation
  - matplotlib and seaborn for visualization
  - requests for API data fetching
- **Machine Learning Model**: Random Forest Regressor
- **Data Source**: World Bank API (with fallback to synthetic data)

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the model:
```bash
python co2_emissions_prediction.py
```

## Model Performance
The model achieves the following metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of errors
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): Penalizes larger errors more heavily
- R-squared (R²): Indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model

## Ethical Considerations
1. **Data Bias**: The model may be biased towards countries with better data collection systems
2. **Fairness**: Predictions should be interpreted in the context of each country's development stage
3. **Transparency**: Model decisions are explainable through feature importance analysis

## Future Improvements
1. Integration of more data sources
2. Implementation of additional machine learning models
3. Development of a web interface for real-time predictions
4. Addition of time-series analysis for trend prediction
